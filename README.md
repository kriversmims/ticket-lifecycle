</p>
<p>
<b>Creation</b> | A user submits a ticket via a web form, or an agent creates it manually. An agent created the above ticket for a password reset.

<!--ASSIGNMENT-->

</p>
<p>
<b>Assignment</b> | The ticket is routed to the appropriate department or agent based on predetermined rules or manual selection. This ensures the right team is notified and responsible for handling the issue. In this instance, as SysAdmin, I changed the SLA to Sev-C and assigned the ticket to John Doe. 
</p>

<!--COMMUNICATION/WORKING-->
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Communication/Working</b> | An assigned agent reviews the ticket and replies to the user with assistance or follow-up questions. The user may respond with additional information or questions, which will ultimately lead to the resolution of the issue.
</p>

<!--RESOLUTION-->

</p>
<p>
